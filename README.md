# Prime Number Sieves in Python

This repo contains different Python scripts to find prime numbers.

All three implementations are optimized to skip even numbers for better performance.

---

## Scripts

### 1. `sieve_of_eratosthenes.py`
The classic method to find all primes up to a number `upper_limit`.

---

### 2. `sieve_of_eratosthenes_triangular_sum.py`
A more experimental version of the sieve of eratosthenes using triangular number logic.

---

### 3. `segmented_sieve.py`
Used for finding primes in a specific range, like `[start, stop]`.

---

## How to Run

Run any file with Python 3:

```bash
python sieve_of_eratosthenes.py
```
